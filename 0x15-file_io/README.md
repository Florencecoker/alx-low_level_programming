n this project, I practiced using the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write and the flags O_RDONLY, WR_ONLY, and O_RDWR to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C. I also learned about the three standard file descriptors and their POSIX names as well as the difference between function and system calls.

0. Tread lightly, she is near; Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
1. Under the snow; Create a function that creates a file.
2. Speak gently, she can hear; Write a function that appends text at the end of a file.
3. cp; Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.
4. elf; Write a program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
